        <body><h1 id = "fresh"></h1>
           <p> Now, this is a story all about how
               <br>
My <span id="noun"></span> got flipped-turned upside down
<br>
And I'd like to take a minute
<br>
Just sit right there
<br>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called <span id="place"></span>
<br>
In <span id="secondplace"></span> born and raised
<br>
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
<br>
chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
<br>
And all shootin' some B-ball outside of the school
<br>
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
<br>
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
<br>
I got in one little fight and <span id="name"></span> got scared
<br>
She said, "<span id="dialogue"></span>"

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
<br>
The license plate said, "<span id="phrase"></span> and it had <span id="noun"></span> in the mirror
<br>
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
<br>
But I thought "na forget it yo holmes to <span id="place"></span>"
<br>
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
<br>
And I yelled to the cabbie, "<span id="dialogue"></span>"
<br>
I looked at my kingdom
<br>
I was finally there
<br>
To sit on my throne as the prince of <span id="place"></span> </p>

<p>Now, this is a story all about how
    <br>
My life got flipped-turned upside down
<br>
And I'd like to take a minute
<br>
Just sit right there
<br>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
<br>
In West Philadelphia born and raised
<br>
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
<br>
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
<br>
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
<br>
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
<br>
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
<br>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
<br>
She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
<br>
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
<br>
The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
<br>
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
<br>
But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air"
<br>
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
<br>
And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later"
<br>
I looked at my kingdom
<br>
I was finally there
<br>
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air </p>
