        <body><h1 id = "fresh"></h1>
           <p> Now, this is a story all about how
My <span id="noun"></span> got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called <span id="place"></span>
In <span id="secondplace"></span> born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some B-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and <span id="name"></span> got scared
She said, "<span id="dialogue"></span>"

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, "<span id="phrase"></span> and it had <span id="noun"></span> in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought "na forget it yo holmes to <span id="place"></span>"
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, "<span id="dialogue"></span>"
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of <span id="place"></span> </p>

<h2>Original version</h2>
<p>Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air"
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later"
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air </p>
